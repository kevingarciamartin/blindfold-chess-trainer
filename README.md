## Accessability & SEO
To ensure that my application is accessible, I have followed best practices for web accessibility. This includes using semantic HTML elements to provide structure and meaning to the content. I have also ensured sufficient color contrast for readability, and provided keyboard navigation support so users can interact with the application without a mouse.

I've improved SEO by adding a meta description element which provides a summary of the application's content that search engines include in search results. A high-quality, unique meta description makes my page appear more relevant and can increase my search traffic.
